  <div class="body2"><p>Something very telling of F-Type customers: Apparently some owners of the 
						previous F-Type felt the car was too quiet at lower speeds. And so the $129,000 
						F-Type SVR was designed to strike fear at red lights with a more amplified growl. 
						But the noise isn’t all show. With a top speed of 200 mile per hour, this is 
						Jaguar’s very competent effort to throw down in the supercar market.</p></div><!-- description of the car -->

  <div class="body2"><p>When the new E-Class debuted in January, the sedan brought with it semi-autonomous 
						drive capabilities found in higher-end Benz models–you could simply keep your hands 
						on the wheel and it would handle itself on the highway. But when you ramp up the engine 
						to a a twin-turbo 3-liter V6 that cranks out 396 horsepower and offers a driver-tunable
						air suspension, you might actually want to take the wheel. While this is no E63 (which 
						puts out 577 hp), the E43, like many of Benz’s AMG models, is still a wolf in sheep’s 
						clothing.</div></p>

  <div class="body2"><p>This is the first new Porsche to use a four-cylinder turbo boxer engine. 
						It’s named after the four-banger, mid-engined racers from the 1950s and 
						’60s. THis new Boxster starts at a friendly $56,000 and will be 
						available around June. Not bad. The “Lava Orange” paint will cost you 
						an extra $2850, however.</p></div>

  <div class="body2"><p>While a lot of the design elements of this Navigator will show up in next year’s
						new model, don’t get too excited about the gullwing doors. They won’t appear on the 
						production model (but there’s always the Tesla Model X if you desire a crossover with such). 
						The most talked about concept car at the New York International Auto Show is a glimpse at 
						what Lincoln hopes to do next with their retro-American,luxe living-room-on-wheels–catch up 
						with the Cadillac Escalade. Perhaps the most thoughtful feature: an intercom system that lets 
						those exiled in the last row to communicate with those up front.</p></div>

  <div class="body2"><p>Three rows, long-distance comfort, and panache are all expected in this class, but the Q7 adds 
						another: agility. The base engine is a 252-hp 2.0-liter turbo four; a 333-hp 3.0-liter 
						supercharged V-6 is optional. Both engines pair with an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive; 
						available four-wheel steering and an air suspension help the Q7 remain composed. The high-quality 
						interior features the latest in infotainment, including the optional Virtual Cockpit, a 12.3-inch 
						driver-facing cluster.</p></div>
