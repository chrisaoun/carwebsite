  <div class="body2"><p>Welcome to the Porsche Mission E – an all-electric sports car revealed at the 
						Frankfurt motor show and one that, if all goes to plan, could prove as significant 
						to Porsche's next 50 years as the 911 has to its past. Over to Wolfgang Hatz, 
						Porsche's R&D boss to explain what on earth is going on. "With this car we 
						intend to start a new era with Porsche, similar to the 911 fifty years ago," 
						Hatz tell us. "This is more than a show car, it's a concept car that we can 
						realise. To put it into production we'll need three to three-and-a-half years.
						"He's not beating around the bush then. In fact, the only reason we need to 
						wait at all is to allow the necessary technology to come on stream.
						Claimed figures for the Mission E? 0-62mph in less than 3.5 seconds; 600bhp from 
						its two e-motors (one on each axle); a range of 500km (312 miles); an 80 per cent 
						charge in 15 minutes thanks to a world-first 800V architecture. Oh, and a weight 
						target of 2,000kg.</p></div><!-- description of the car -->

  <div class="body2"><p>Dual Motor Model S is a categorical improvement on conventional all-wheel drive systems. 
						With two motors, one in the front and one in the rear, Model S digitally and independently 
						controls torque to the front and rear wheels. The result is unparalleled traction control 
						in all conditions. Conventional all-wheel drive cars employ complex mechanical linkages 
						to distribute power from a single engine to all four wheels. This sacrifices efficiency 
						in favor of all weather traction. In contrast, each Model S motor is lighter, smaller and
						more efficient than its rear wheel drive counterpart, providing both improved range and 
						faster acceleration. Model S Performance comes standard with All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor,
						pairing the high performance rear motor with a high efficiency front motor to achieve 
						supercar acceleration, from zero to 100 km/h in 2.7 seconds.</div></p>

  <div class="body2"><p>The 2018 Infiniti Q100 is expected to be a gorgeous gift wrapped in a ridiculous price tag. 
						The new four-wheel and rear-wheel drive system will be shared with Infiniti’s other uber 
						luxury automobile; both of which are expected to take on the Bentley Continental GT, Nissan GT-R, 
						Porsche 911 Turbo, Mercedes-Benz S-class and BMW 7-Series. Infinity’s CEO recently announced that 
						they have abandoned V-8’s in all future products. With the release of the 2009 Essence concept that 
						inspired this model, the Infinity will feature a twin-turbo 6-cylinder hybrid system with outputs 
						exceeding 600-horsepower. As one of Infinity’s most expensive automobiles, the Q100 will cost around
						$150,000 for the base model with more bells and whistles available at a higher price point.</p></div>

  <div class="body2"><p>Brutally powerful and obscenely flamboyant, the Aventador is unburdened by reality. Crazy expensive 
						and crazy fast, it’s capable of amazing performance without feeling like it’s going to spin out into 
						a ditch, which is refreshing in a supercar. Available as a coupe (for now), it has a 6.5-liter 730-hp 
						V-12, a 7-speed automated manual transmission and all-wheel drive. For the ultimate, the Superveloce 
						has 740 hp and a claimed top speed of 217 mph. In our testing, it did 0-60 mph in 2.7 seconds.</p></div>

  <div class="body2"><p>Fully electric, the I.D. Concept has a theoretical range of between 400 and 600 km. According 
						to the manufacturer, it should cost about as much as a well-equipped Golf—so let’s say around 
						$30,000—as well as go from 0 to 100 km/h in eight seconds and eventually hit 160 km/h.Not 
						exactly a rocketship, but it should be enough for city driving.Volkswagen also unveiled an autonomous 
						driving system with this concept. It reads the road via its ten lasers and sensors, and is also in 
						constant communication with the cloud. However, VW says they won’t offer this system until 2025 on 
						this car.</p></div>
