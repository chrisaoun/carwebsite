  <div class="body2"><p>With a new name reflecting both its modern design and premium luxury, the 2017 GLS 
						sets countless new standard for full-size 7-passenger SUVs. With three rows of 
						first-class seating and class-leading new safety systems, it pairs comfort with 
						confidence like no other. From cargo carrying to trailer towing, its capacities are as 
						vast as the capabilities imparted by its 4MATIC all-wheel drive, Crosswind Assist and 
						more. When you compare large SUVs, examine the dimensions that matter most: The depth 
						of their engineering. And the strength of their character.</p></div><!-- description of the car -->

  <div class="body2"><p>Unveiled at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, the new 2016 Porsche Cayenne Turbo S
						is the most powerful SUV to ever come out of Stuttgart, Germany. This iteration of the Cayenne Turbo S 
						is the first vehicle in its class to beat the 8-minute mark around the famed Nürburgring racetrack, stripping 
						the title of the fastest SUV in the world away from Land Rover. Along with this improved performance come 
						added interior amenities, including Alcantara, custom color schemes, and carbon-fiber interior accents. 
						The SUV is powered by a 4.8-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine that can produce 570 hp and 590 ft lbs of torque. 
						Porsche has integrated turbochargers into the engine’s exhaust manifolds, helping the Cayenne accelerate 
						from zero to 60 mph in 3.8 seconds and reach a top speed of 176 mph. The Turbo S is also equipped with ceramic 
						brakes, 21-inch wheels, and torque vectoring.The 2016 Porsche Cayenne Turbo S is expected to hit U.S. Porsche 
						dealerships in April, with a starting price of $158,295.</p></div>
