  <div class="desc"><b>BMW iVision i3</b></div>
  <div class="body2"><p>BMW is often seen as having the latest and greatest new little toys in their 
						vehicles. And the concepts in the i-Vision are no exception. With it’s 3-D 
						instrument cluster display which boasts a 21 inch panorama display screen, 
						one would think a person should be concerned about being distracted while driving.
						This is apparently not a problem, because BMW has included not only a Bump Assist 
						(which will take a picture of anything that more than nudges the bumper of the car, 
						which would hopefully provide a license plate number to follow up on), they have Assist 
						driving, which real-time navigation, complete with accounting for weather and all 
						traffic conditions, can help if it notices any danger.If that is not enough, there 
						is also the Auto mode which is mostly for long-stretch freeway driving.  It allows the 
						driver to take their eyes off of the monotonous road until they are needed again. 
						The car will alert the driver a few seconds before they need to take up the reigns again.
						While we are not likely to see this car in and of itself, be sure that BMW will be adding 
						these different features to their upcoming models as soon as possible.</p></div>

  <div class="body2"><p>Fully electric, the I.D. Concept has a theoretical range of between 400 and 600 km. According 
						to the manufacturer, it should cost about as much as a well-equipped Golf—so let’s say around 
						$30,000—as well as go from 0 to 100 km/h in eight seconds and eventually hit 160 km/h.Not 
						exactly a rocketship, but it should be enough for city driving.Volkswagen also unveiled an autonomous 
						driving system with this concept. It reads the road via its ten lasers and sensors, and is also in 
						constant communication with the cloud. However, VW says they won’t offer this system until 2025 on 
						this car.</p></div>
