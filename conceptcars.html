  <div class="body2"><p>When the new E-Class debuted in January, the sedan brought with it semi-autonomous 
						drive capabilities found in higher-end Benz models–you could simply keep your hands 
						on the wheel and it would handle itself on the highway. But when you ramp up the engine 
						to a a twin-turbo 3-liter V6 that cranks out 396 horsepower and offers a driver-tunable
						air suspension, you might actually want to take the wheel. While this is no E63 (which 
						puts out 577 hp), the E43, like many of Benz’s AMG models, is still a wolf in sheep’s 
						clothing.</div></p>

  <div class="body2"><p>This is the first new Porsche to use a four-cylinder turbo boxer engine. 
						It’s named after the four-banger, mid-engined racers from the 1950s and 
						’60s. THis new Boxster starts at a friendly $56,000 and will be 
						available around June. Not bad. The “Lava Orange” paint will cost you 
						an extra $2850, however.</p></div>

  <div class="desc"><b>BMW iVision i3</b></div>
  <div class="body2"><p>BMW is often seen as having the latest and greatest new little toys in their 
						vehicles. And the concepts in the i-Vision are no exception. With it’s 3-D 
						instrument cluster display which boasts a 21 inch panorama display screen, 
						one would think a person should be concerned about being distracted while driving.
						This is apparently not a problem, because BMW has included not only a Bump Assist 
						(which will take a picture of anything that more than nudges the bumper of the car, 
						which would hopefully provide a license plate number to follow up on), they have Assist 
						driving, which real-time navigation, complete with accounting for weather and all 
						traffic conditions, can help if it notices any danger.If that is not enough, there 
						is also the Auto mode which is mostly for long-stretch freeway driving.  It allows the 
						driver to take their eyes off of the monotonous road until they are needed again. 
						The car will alert the driver a few seconds before they need to take up the reigns again.
						While we are not likely to see this car in and of itself, be sure that BMW will be adding 
						these different features to their upcoming models as soon as possible.</p></div>

  <div class="body2"><p>Three rows, long-distance comfort, and panache are all expected in this class, but the Q7 adds 
						another: agility. The base engine is a 252-hp 2.0-liter turbo four; a 333-hp 3.0-liter 
						supercharged V-6 is optional. Both engines pair with an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive; 
						available four-wheel steering and an air suspension help the Q7 remain composed. The high-quality 
						interior features the latest in infotainment, including the optional Virtual Cockpit, a 12.3-inch 
						driver-facing cluster.</p></div>
